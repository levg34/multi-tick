## Calculated alarm from target

- Car
if car selected, alarm at Target time + 3mn
if time in < time + 3mn orange
if time > target red
(display arrival time TODO: find API)

- Tramway
if tram selected
target time (tramway passage time) + 5mn = orange
if target time in < 3mn, show next target passage time green and old one red
always show next passage time (from XX:XX ? or always)

## Fill in Target list
